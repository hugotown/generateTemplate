# Cakeular CakePHP Plugin

Cakeular is a Angular.js Plugin for CakePHP. It creates a RESTful JSON API service from your models and Angular.js views. 

## Requirements

The master branch has the following requirements:

* CakePHP 2.2.0 or greater.
* PHP 5.3.0 or greater.

## Installation

1. Clone/Copy the files in this directory into `app/Plugin/Cakeular`.
2. Ensure the plugin is loaded in `app/Config/bootstrap.php` by calling `CakePlugin::loadAll(array('Cakeular' => array('routes' => true)));`.
3. Copy Console/Command/CakeularShell.php to /app/Console/Command/
4. Copy Console/Command/Task/CakeularTask.php to /app/Console/Command/Task/
5. Copy /app/Plugin/Cakeular/Config/cakeular.php to /app/Config/cakeular.php
6. Put the URL where your API will be hosted. The default routing expects this to be //api.yourhost

### Install as Git submodule

You can replace Step 1 above with the following to add Cakeular to your CakePHP project as a submodule:

```
$ cd /path/to/CakePHP/project/
$ git submodule add https://github.com/mcred/Cakeular.git app/Plugin/Cakeular
```

### Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) 

Your server must allow CORS from the requesting application. This can be enabled a few ways. The easiest I have found is to allow the host for my application to the .htaccess file in the /app folder. Add the following lines: 
```
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "localhost or yourserver"
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS"
```

# Usage

1. Create your Database Schema following Cake Convention.
2. `./cake bake all` for your Models. 
3. Select Cakeular as your Template. 
4. `./cake cakular` for your Models. 
5. Do not select to Interactively Bake and select Cakeular as the Template. 

# Documentation

## Cakeular Console Templates

We have included Console Templates to allow you to easily bake a project and gain Angular functionality throughout.

To utilize the Console Templates simply bake your project like usual but select `Cakeular` when it asks you which template you would like to use.

##API Routes

The standard Cake controller methods are replaced by a RESTful JSON API. So instead of viewing an individual record for your model by going to `/model/view/:id`, JSON data for this record can be seen by a GET request to `/model/:id`. The replacement for Cake methods are as follows:

`/model/index/` becomes a GET request to `/model/`<br />
`/model/view/:id` becomes a GET request to `/model/:id`<br />
`/model/add` becomes a POST request to `/model/`, send the model as the 'body' of a POST as a JSON string.<br />
`/model/edit/:id` becomes a POST request to `/model/`, send the model as the 'body' of a POST as a JSON string.<br />
`/model/delete:id` becomes a DELETE request to `/model/`<br />

##Angular Views

The standard Cake views are replaced by a single index.ctp file that runs an Angular App. Each model has an Angular controller file created in /app/webroot/js. HTML templates are created for each view in /app/webroot/view/model/.
